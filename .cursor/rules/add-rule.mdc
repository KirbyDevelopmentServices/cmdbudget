# Creating Cursor Rules

Cursor rules are custom documentation that help the AI understand your codebase. Here's how to create effective rules:

## Rule Structure
- Rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` as `.mdc` files
- Each rule should have a clear purpose and description
- Use the frontmatter section to configure rule behavior

## Frontmatter Options
- `description`: Brief summary of what the rule explains (shown in rule list)
- `globs`: File patterns the rule applies to (e.g., `["*.js", "src/**/*.tsx"]`)
- `alwaysApply`: Set to `true` to apply this rule to all conversations

## Content Tips
- Use markdown for formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Reference specific files with `@filepath` syntax
- Include code examples when relevant
- Keep rules concise but informative
- Focus on architectural patterns, conventions, and gotchas

## How to Use Rules
- Rules are automatically provided to AI when relevant to your query
- You can explicitly reference rules with `@rule-name` in your prompts
