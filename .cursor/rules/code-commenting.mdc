# Code Commenting Standards

Leave detailed inline comments for complex logic to ensure maintainability and clarity.

## Docstrings
- Provide clear, concise docstrings for all classes and public methods
- Explain purpose, arguments, and return values
- Follow Google-style docstring format

Example:
```python
def process_transaction(raw_transaction: RawTransaction) -> Transaction:
    """Convert a RawTransaction to a fully processed Transaction.
    
    Args:
        raw_transaction: The raw transaction data from CSV import
        
    Returns:
        A processed Transaction object with category and subcategory
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the transaction data is invalid
    """
```

## Inline Comments
- Focus on **why** rather than **what** the code is doing
- Explain complex algorithms or business logic
- Document any non-obvious behavior or edge cases
- Clearly mark workarounds or temporary solutions

## Critical Areas for Comments
- Transaction processing/splitting logic
- Category management
- Date parsing and normalization
- Currency handling
- Duplicate detection
- Configuration loading/validation
