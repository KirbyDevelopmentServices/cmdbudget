# Documentation Maintenance

Maintain and update key documentation files as the project evolves:

## README.md
- Update with new features or usage changes
- Ensure installation and setup instructions remain accurate
- Document command-line options, config file specifications, and usage examples
- Keep sections organized and consistent with current implementation

## product/ROADMAP.md
- Check off completed items as features are implemented
- Add new planned features with clear descriptions
- Organize by priority and category (Transaction Importing, Management, Reporting, etc.)
- Mark in-progress items appropriately

## product/FIXED.md
- Document each bug fix with detailed context:
  - Date of fix
  - Description of the bug
  - Root cause analysis
  - Solution implemented
  - Preventive measures added

## Knowledge Base (KB.AI)
- Add new architectural decisions and implementation details
- Document technical specifications and configurations
- Update feature descriptions as they're implemented
- Record implementation challenges and solutions
- Maintain detailed component descriptions

## Rules Documentation (RULES.AI)
- Record coding conventions and rules
- Document file tagging requirements
- Maintain special coding notes and guidelines
- Update as patterns and best practices evolve
- Reference as a source of truth for code style decisions

## Product Requirements (product/PRD.md)
- Define product vision and scope
- Document user personas and needs
- Track high-level progress of feature implementation
- Prioritize feature development
- Reference feature directories in product/features/

## Feature Documentation (product/features/)

### Structure
Maintain the following structure for each feature:
```
/product/features/<feature_name>/
  ├── overview.md           # High-level overview of the feature
  └── user_stories/         # Directory containing user stories
      ├── story1.md         # Individual user story files
      ├── story2.md
      └── ...
```

### Feature Overview (overview.md)
- Provide one-paragraph description of the feature, its need, and implementation
- List high-level tasks required for implementation
- Leave "Analysis of complexity" section blank for Technical Architect

### User Stories (user_stories/*.md)
- Write from product perspective without technical details
- Focus on clear product requirements
- Include specific acceptance criteria
- Document from user's perspective (As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit])
- Organize by specific functionality or user flow

## Cursor Rules
- Create new cursor rules for concepts requiring frequent reference
- Keep cursor rules concise and focused on single topics
- Update existing rules when conventions change
- Ensure rules reference KB.AI and RULES.AI for deeper details
