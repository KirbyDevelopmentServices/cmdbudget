# File Tagging Patterns

When creating any new file, always tag it as AI generated using these consistent patterns:

## Python Files
Add these comments to the first 3 lines of each Python file:
```python
# AI generated and maintained by Claude 3.7 Sonnet
# This file [brief description of file purpose]
# License: MIT
```

## Markdown Files
Add this HTML comment after the title:
```markdown
<!-- AI generated and maintained by Claude 3.7 Sonnet -->
```

## Other Text Files
Add this line near the top:
```
*AI GENERATED AND MAINTAINED BY Claude 3.7 Sonnet*
```

Always use the current model identifier when tagging files. If the identifier changes in the future, use the new one.
