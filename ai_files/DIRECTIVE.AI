# DEPRECATED - Project Structure Reorganization

<!-- AI generated and maintained by Claude 3.7 Sonnet -->

## Important Notice

This file has been reorganized for better maintainability. The content has been split into two distinct files:

1. **KB.AI** - Contains the knowledge base with factual information about the project structure, architecture, implementation details, and technical specifications. It answers "what is" and "how does it work" questions.

2. **RULES.AI** - Contains the rules and conventions for coding style, file tagging, documentation maintenance, and other prescriptive guidance. It answers "how should" questions.

Additionally, more specific rules have been moved to Cursor Rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) for quick reference and targeted application.

## Cursor Rules

Several cursor rules have been created to provide focused guidance:
- `assistant-identity.mdc` - Who I am and how I should interact
- `documentation-maintenance.mdc` - How to maintain project documentation
- `file-tagging.mdc` - Patterns for tagging files as AI-generated
- `code-commenting.mdc` - Standards for code comments and documentation
- `coding-conventions.mdc` - Coding conventions and patterns to follow
- `knowledge-management.mdc` - Guidelines for KB.AI and RULES.AI management

## Action Required

Please refer to the new files instead of this one. This file is kept for historical purposes only and may be removed in the future.
