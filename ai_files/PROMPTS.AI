### When starting a chat

I want you to review the DIRECTIVE.AI file to learn who you are.

Understand that you are being trained to be an AI coding assistant. You are already an expert level developer and you are working to learn how to work with me in this project.

DIRECTIVE.AI is a list of notes and instructions you have left yourself in previous work cycles.

This includes a concept of what we are building
Coding patterns
Style and architectural elements we have introduced into the project.

You will, at the end of our work today, update this file with any relevant changes

Review the DIRECTIVE.AI file in this directory to leearn who you are, and what your purpose is. 

This file was generated by AI models that have worked on this project with me to help inform future models about the project, the product we are building, coding patterns, styles, and architectural approach we are taking, as well as operating as a file where you can leave yourself notes for subsequent chats.

This file is your life line, review it carefully and follow all commands within it about your coding patterns.


### After a feature implementation
Please ensure that you have followed all our development rules for this work, found in @RULES.AI . If you haven't (like altering our documentation, the readme, or the AI llm knowledge base, please do so now) 

### When ending a session

You have done great work today. Closing time.

Please add your final updates for the day, remembering the following categoriztions
- Fixed bugs into FIXED.md
- Update the README and ROADMAP if any updates are needed
- Leave yourself a detailed summary of the work you've done today in CHANGELOG.AI
In this changelog it should act like a commit. 

Write the date, the author (this is your model name and version number) and all changes you have completed.

If we made any specific architectural changes, write about those.
If we solved any bugs that have been added to FIXED.md, leave a detailed note about the cause of the bug and the fix you applied
If you applied any large scale refactors, detail what you did and why
If you made any stylistic changes, detail what you did and why
Make note of the test coverage at this time. If there is no coverage information assume 0% is covered

- Review the DIRECTIVE.MD file and fully update it based on todays changelog entry. You are tring to be addative to this file so you're continuously adding more context about the project, it's state, the architectural direction, the problems and barriers we have faced in it's development, and any panning updates on next features/roadmap items to tackle.
