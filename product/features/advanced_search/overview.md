## High level overview
The Advanced Search System enables users to find transactions using multiple criteria including date ranges, amounts, categories, descriptions, and tags. This feature addresses the current limitation where users can only view transactions by month, making it difficult to locate specific transactions or analyze spending across custom time periods. By providing a powerful and flexible search capability, users will be able to quickly find transactions, perform targeted analysis, and gain deeper insights into their spending patterns.
