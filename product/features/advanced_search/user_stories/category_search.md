# User Story: Search Transactions by Category and Subcategory

<!-- AI generated and maintained by Claude 3.7 Sonnet -->

## Description
As a user who categorizes my transactions, I want to search for transactions by category and subcategory, so that I can analyze spending patterns within specific expense types and make budgeting decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can search for transactions by main category
- Users can search for transactions by subcategory
- Users can search for all subcategories within a main category
- Multiple categories or subcategories can be included in a single search
- Category searches can be combined with other search criteria
- Search results display the category criteria used
- Results are grouped by category/subcategory in the display when appropriate
- Special system categories (IGNORED, SPLIT) are supported in searches
- Search results include options to summarize spending by category

## Notes
- Consider how to handle transactions that have been split across multiple categories
- Users often want to compare spending across related categories
- Support for hierarchical category display would be helpful for complex category structures
- Some users may want to exclude certain categories from search results
