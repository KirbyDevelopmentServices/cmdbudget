# User Story: Search Results Display and Formatting

<!-- AI generated and maintained by Claude 3.7 Sonnet -->

## Description
As a user who performs transaction searches, I want flexible options for displaying and formatting search results, so that I can analyze the data effectively and extract meaningful insights from my search queries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can sort search results by various fields (date, amount, category, description)
- Sort order can be toggled between ascending and descending
- Users can choose between compact and detailed views of search results
- Display includes summary statistics for the search results (total count, sum of amounts, etc.)
- Users can group results by different fields (date, month, category, tag)
- Search results can be limited to a specified number of transactions
- The display includes pagination for large result sets
- Column visibility and order can be customized
- Results maintain consistent currency formatting with appropriate symbols

## Notes
- Terminal display has limited space, so formatting needs to be efficient
- Consider supporting export of search results for external analysis
- Users may want different views depending on the type of analysis they're performing
- Summary statistics are particularly important for financial analysis
