# User Story: Currency-Specific Reporting

<!-- AI generated and maintained by Claude 3.7 Sonnet -->

## Description
As a user who manages expenses in multiple currencies, I want to see reports that properly handle and display multi-currency data, so that I can understand my spending patterns accurately across different currencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Monthly spending reports show amounts with their respective currency indicators
- Reports provide subtotals grouped by currency
- Category history analysis shows spending in each currency separately
- Tag analysis maintains currency separation when displaying amounts
- Percentage changes from previous periods are calculated within the same currency
- Visual distinction exists between amounts in different currencies
- Currency symbols or codes are consistently displayed alongside amounts in all reports
- Option to view reports for a specific currency only

## Notes
- Users often want to see spending totals grouped by currency rather than converted
- Currency conversion for reporting purposes could be considered as a future enhancement
- Consider right-to-left display conventions for currency symbols
- Reports should clarify that cross-currency comparisons (e.g., total spending across all currencies) are not direct equivalents
